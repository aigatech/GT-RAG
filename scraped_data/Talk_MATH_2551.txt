Title: Talk:MATH 2551
Content:
	For the Prerequisites, AP Calc BC gives credit for MATH 1552. So I'm thinking of just removing the AP credit part.  
Instead, when the MATH 1552 page is created, we can mention that AP Calc BC gives credit for that class. That way when 1st years see a prereq listed as MATH 1552 (and they probably won't know what that course number is anyway), they can just click on it to go to that page, and there it will say what gives credit for that class. --Alexp (talk) 18:56, 20 May 2021 (EDT)
