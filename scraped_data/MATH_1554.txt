Title: MATH 1554 - Linear Algebra
Content:
	MATH 1554 covers linear systems, matrices, eigenvalues, orthogonality, and SVD.
	* Topic not covered in MATH 1553
	MATH 1554 is a core math class with a focus on theory. However, MATH 1554 does not use formal proofs, and it still does have many computational problems. The theoretical nature of MATH 1554 can be challenging for first-year students who are used to more computation-heavy algebra and calculus courses.
	Almost no prerequisite knowledge is required, apart from algebra and trigonometry.
	MATH 1554 is required for math and cs majors. Due to having almost no prerequisites, MATH 1554 is generally taken during freshmen year. Future calculus classes, such as multivariable calculus and differential equations will use linear algebra concepts such as matrices, determinants, and eigenvalues. In addition, linear algebra is especially important for cs majors, who take many classes that require linear algebra, such as MATH 3012 and CS 3510.
