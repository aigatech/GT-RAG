Title: ECE 2040 - Circuit Analysis
Content:
	ECE 2040 is a 3 credit hour class with no lab requirement. It is an elective for electrical engineering majors and a requirement for computer engineering majors.[1] ECE 2040 is an introductory course that teaches methods of circuit analysis, an understanding of the physical laws governing circuits, and linear elements used in circuits (i.e. resistors, capacitors, inductors).  Several lab projects utilizing the myDAQ, a data acquisition device also used in ECE 2020 and ECE 3084, are featured in the course. Students are required to either purchase a myDAQ or check one out from the library for ECE 2040.
	This topic list is from spring 2021.[1]
	ECE 2040 is a prerequisite for many courses in the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering.  These courses are listed below.
	Many of the above courses are also requirements for EE and CompE degrees--these courses may be prerequisites for other major-required courses or for certain electives.
	ECE 2040 is also a pre or co-requisite for some non-ECE classes:
	ECE 2040 is not a linked course.
