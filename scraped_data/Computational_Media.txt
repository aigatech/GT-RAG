Title: Computational Media
Content:
	Computational Media (CM) is a Bachelor's of Science program offered by the Georgia Institute of Technology. It is a joint offering from the College of Computing and School of Literature, Media, and Communications, that is designed to "provide a thorough education in all aspects of the computer as a medium: the technical, the historical-critical, and the applied [1]." Although CM is one of the newer and smaller undergraduate programs to be offered by Georgia Tech, having started with only one student in 2004 [2], it is now nationally recognized within its own right, with its video game design course being ranked #3 in the nation according to the 2022-2023 U.S. News & World Report [3].
	For more information on degree requirements, Junior Design Capstone options, and threads, see CM Degree Requirements.
	The Computational Media course structure is most similar to Computer Engineering's in nature; students are required to choose a thread, or specialization, in two different disciplines.  Students who major in Computational Media have to choose from one of three threads from the Computer Science program: Intelligence, People, or Media, and either Music Technology or one of three threads from the Literature, Media, and Communications program: Interaction Design (formerly Experimental Media and Interaction Design), Game Studies, or Film and Media Studies [5].
	Computer Science (CS) Threads
	* In lieu of CS 4510 (Automata and Complexity Theory), CM majors take another specialized class, as they are neither required to take MATH 3012 (Applied Combinatorics) nor any statistics course, both of which are prerequisites for CS 4510. For more information on CS threads, see Thread (Computer Science).
	Literature, Media, and Communications (LMC) Threads
	Music Technology
	Students choose from one of the CS threads and either Music Technology or one of the LMC threads.
