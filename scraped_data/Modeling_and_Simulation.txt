Title: Modeling and Simulation
Content:
	The Modeling and Simulation thread, also known colloquially as "Modsim", is one of the eight threads available to undergraduate Computer Science majors and minors.
	The Modeling and Simulation thread exposes students to computer-driven models of complex phenomena. Statistical and numerical methods are heavily utilized to model complex natural and human-made phenomena, such as weather systems, population growth, or logistics. A strong foundation in mathematics and algorithms is recommended for this thread.
	For computer science majors who decide to pursue Modeling and Simulation as one of their two threads, the requirements are below:
	*CS 1171 not offered anymore; likely replaced by free elective[1]
Table:
	Degree Requirements
	Course	|	Description
	CS 1171*	|	Introductory Computing in MATLAB (1)
	CS 2110	|	Computer Organization and Programming(4)
	CS 2200	|	Computer Systems and Networks (4)
	CS 3510	|	Design and Analysis of Algorithms (3)
	MATH 2552	|	Differential Equations (4)
	CS 4641 or CX 4140 or CX 4220 or CX 4230 or CX 4640	|	Computational Science and Engineering Electives (6, choose 2)
