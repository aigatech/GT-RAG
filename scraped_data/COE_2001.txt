Title: COE 2001 - Statics
Content:
	COE 2001 covers the mechanics of systems at rest, including forces and moments, equilibrium, structures, distributed forces, and friction. The course is foundational for many engineering majors.
	The course features a topic per week on average, with the first day of lecture being instructor-led problems while the second day of lecture being group/individual problems. 1-3 short videos are required to watch before the first lecture to introduce the content for the week.
	Homework and quizzes occur on alternating weeks, with quizzes being open notes. The final exam may be exempted with a 97 or higher average in the rest of the course.
	PHYS 2211 or its equivalents is an important prerequisite for COE 2001. Statics can be seen as an extension of introductory mechanics, focusing specifically on systems in equilibrium. For example, while equilibrium is introduced in PHYS 2211, COE 2001 will discuss more complex systems in equilibrium, such as 3D systems and structures.
	While MATH 1552 is listed as a prerequisite for COE 2001, COE 2001 is not a heavily calculus-based course. However, integrals are used towards the end of the course when dealing with distributed loads.
	While linear algebra is not a prerequisite for COE 2001, an understanding of linear systems can provide greater insight into statics. For example, row reduction and augmented matrices can be used to solve complex equilibrium problems
	COE 2001 is an important prerequisite class for several engineering majors, including ME, AE, and CivE. COE 2001 is typically taken during freshmen year or early sophomore year for this reason.
