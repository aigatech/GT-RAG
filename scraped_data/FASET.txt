Title: FASET
Content:
	FASET is the orientation program for new students, where they receive academic advisement, register for first semester classes, and become familiarized with undergraduate curriculum, programs, and campus services. Attending FASET costs $115, and it has traditionally taken place on campus over two days, accommodating parents and siblings. Out-of-state and international students may choose a FASET session right before the semester starts so they can stay on campus afterwards.
	Due to COVID-19, GT has given the opportunity for students in 2021 to choose between in-person and virtual FASET sessions, ranging from June to August for students not doing iGniTe.[1]
	To prepare for course registration, students should plan out a schedule before their FASET session. Be sure that all test scores, including AP, IB, SAT, ACT, A-levels, etc., have been sent to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions, and confirm that they have been received by checking Degree Works.
	If students' test scores have not been received yet, then they can request prerequisite overrides provided that they have proof of their scores. Requesting an override without proof will most likely be unsuccessful, and should a student attempt to register for classes that have prerequisites satisfied by those credits, OSCAR will display a prerequisite error.[2]
	Class registration at Georgia Tech is done via OSCAR, short for "Online Student Computer Assisted Registration." To access OSCAR, first sign in via the "Secure Access Login" link. Then, click on "Student Services & Financial Aid" followed by "Registration." This page is the registration menu, and provides several helpful links for class registration.
	Classes can only be added and dropped during a student's time ticket.[3] To view time ticket information, click "Registration Status" and select the fall term. In addition, OSCAR will show if a student has registration holds or not on this page.
	Even though classes can only be added or dropped during students' time tickets, students may view availability for all classes at any time by selecting "Look Up Classes" in the registration menu. The Registrar provides information on how to interpret class data in OSCAR. During a student's time ticket, they will also be able to add and drop courses via these pages.[4]
	Another method for class registration is to click "Add/Drop Classes" in the registration menu. Course Reference Numbers (CRNs) can be entered all at once, allowing for quicker registration. Of course, "Add/Drop Classes" can only be used during a time ticket.[4]
	Students will register with their FASET group, and FASET leaders, advisors, and the Registrar will be available to help students during class registration. The order in which FASET groups register for classes has not been observed to depend on incoming credits. In addition, spots for common first-year classes will open during or before each FASET, so an earlier FASET date does not give an advantage unless registering for upper-level courses, which will not have many spots available anyways.
	Many students are unable to get all the classes that they want during FASET, and this is completely normal. Students will have another chance to register for classes during Phase 2. Students who do not attend FASET will begin course registration during Phase 2, and students still awaiting test scores on their FASET date will be given an additional time ticket for Phase "AP".
