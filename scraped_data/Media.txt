Title: Media
Content:
	The Media thread is one of the eight threads available to undergraduate Computer Science majors and minors.
	The Media thread explores the various creative capabilities of computing technologies to deliver novel experiences. The thread offers a wide variety of paths to tailor one's exploration into new media, including but not limited to the applications of computing in game design, photography, aesthetics, audio, and animation. Students gain a technical understanding of how various forms of media are represented in software, and they learn how to design digital media that harnesses the power of computation to achieve inventive forms of expression.
	For computer science majors who decide to pursue Media as one of their two threads, the requirements are below:
	*CS 2261 may be taken instead of CS 2110 if the student elects to add People as their second thread.[1]
	For non-majors who decide to pursue the Computing and Media minor, the requirements are below:
	Before announcing your intention to declare the minor, you must take and pass CS 1301, CS 1315, or CS 1371 with a B or higher and CS 1331 with a B or higher.
