Title: TODO
Content:
	See: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Backing_up_a_wiki
	For example, use automysqlbackup and send the daily/weekly backups to an aws s3 bucket
	Maybe follow this tutorialor similar. Also, would be nice to keep daily backups for past month, but then only weekly longer than that. Not sure how to do that, but I'm sure it's been done before.
	Note: the s3 bucket needs to be secure as it contains logins[citation needed]
	Also, need to create a backup of the LocalSettings.php configuration file. And the /images directory once ppl start uploading files here...
	probably will more the wiki to a cheaper lightsail server soon, since it's using <800Mb of ram, hopefully 1Gb will be enough. and in a year, probably will handoff the server to someone else
	Another option is to Export or Publish the mediawiki and upload the data to a public git repo.
	Ideally, the wiki could also be published to static-pages hosted by GitHub pages
	That way, there will always be a read-only copy of all the pages
	Looking at using https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Parsoid to translate xml dumps to html
	Alternatively, https://github.com/openzim/mwoffliner is basically a web-scraper so it's kinda dumb to webscrape your own server but whatever
	Looks like someone already started: http://gt-student-wiki.org/mediawiki/index.php/First_Year_FAQ
	Done; gmail account created
	Update: no longer friends with gmail, aws ses is my new best friend
	https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Securing_database_passwords
	Should be fairly easy to do (using AWS route 53 rn)
	... Ok, this is done. I mostly followed https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/articles/amazon-lightsail-using-lets-encrypt-certificates-with-lamp#link-the-lets-encrypt-certificate-files-in-the-apache-directory-lamp (using the Route 53 hosted zone to add the TXT stuff to) but had to make a few changes to the apache2 configuration. Right now it seems to work, and it auto-redirects http to https. I had to edit the default 000 configuration and add ServerName and ServerAlias, and ran certbot --apache. I really need to put a step-by-step tutorial or something for myself and others so I remember how to do it...
	There was also one thing in the config that I forgot about: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:$wgServer, had to change it to https or editing wouldn't work (got REST error)
	run: sudo certbot --preferred-challenges dns certonly --manual -d 'gt-student-wiki.org,*.gt-student-wiki.org'
	As prompted, update TXT entries in AWS Route 53
	You can use a website like this oneto check if that worked.
	Then, reload apache: sudo service apache2 restart ...and then check for a new expiration date for the cert using browser
	Something similar to this: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Topic:Rg8scj0rl4iqulmg
