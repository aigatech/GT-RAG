Title: PHYS 2211
Content:
	Physics 1 (Mechanics) is "A calculus-based course with a laboratory covering classical mechanics, applications of classical mechanics, oscillations, and waves."[1]
	Classical: more calculus, recitation section (shorter lab period), generally considered more difficult than modern.
	Modern: programming in Python (don't worry, it's pretty simple programming)
	This is a linked course. However, the lecture section codes no longer correspond to the lab section codes. See the ME department guide (Fall 20) for an explanation.
	For current info on which lectures correspond to which labs, read this OSCAR page (Fall 2023). For example, Section A said in Fall 2022:
	You must also register for one of the following: PHYS 2211 Y01 - Y10
	And so on for the other sections.
	In addition, some sections are major-restricted or study abroad. Make sure to check the OSCAR page and/or the ME dept guide!
	For the lecture sections, notice how they all include one time-block very late in the day. This is likely the test period, which will only meet a few times per semester. [TODO some1 confirm]
	Labs use very basic Python, and tests occasionally ask for the Python equivalent of vector math.
	Don't be intimidated by the programming, since it is relatively straightforward and you can ask for help from TAs and other students in labs.
	If you are still concerned about Python, this website has tutorials which are extremely similar to your Physics labs.
