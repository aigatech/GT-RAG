	Make sure major pages aren't copy paste from other Georgia Tech websites
	The core major requirements are common for all engineering majors, correct? If so, we should probable put the core requirements on a dedicated page, and then use https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Transclusion to insert them. That way, we might be able to reference one copy for all engineering pages. --Alexp (talk) 19:06, 20 May 2021 (EDT)
	The info about these clubs and student organizations is great, but some of these clubs aren't exclusive to EE... maybe frame it as "a lot of EE majors are in these clubs:" or something --Alexp (talk) 15:15, 21 May 2021 (EDT)
