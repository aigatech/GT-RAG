Title: CHEM 2311 - Organic Chemistry I
Content:
	CHEM 2311: Organic Chemistry I is a 3 credit initial course in organic chemistry. It is intended for students majoring in Chemistry, Biology, Biochemistry, or Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, as well as pre-health students.[1] It is immediately succeeded by CHEM 2312 or CHEM 2313, and it is immediately preceded by CHEM 1212K.
	The textbook used is Organic Chemistry by Solomons and Fryhle. Homework consists of online auto-graded problems, and there are optional weekly recitations and PLUS sessions. CHEM 2311 has no lab section.
	Organic chemistry is widely considered to be a difficult course; grading may be curved, and exams may have substantial extra credit.
	This topic list is from spring 2019.
	CHEM 2311 is not a linked course, but it has a recitation. However, the recitation is a component of the course itself, having no separate section, so students only register for a lecture section.
