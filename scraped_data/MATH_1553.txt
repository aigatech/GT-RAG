Title: MATH 1553
Content:
	MATH 1553 is a 2 credit core math class in linear algebra.
	Almost no prerequisite knowledge is required, apart from algebra and trigonometry.
	MATH 1553 does not give credit for MATH 1554 or 1564.
	MATH 1553 is a linked course with a studio and shared test period.
Bullet Points:
	- 1 Topic List
	- 2 Prerequisite Knowledge
	- 3 Equivalent Courses
	- 4 Registration
	- 5 Resources
Bullet Points:
	- Systems of Linear Equations
	- Vectors in Rn
	- Linear Independence and Transformations
	- Matrix Algebra
	- Subspaces in Rn
	- Determinants
	- Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors (includes Complex Eigenvalues if time permits)
	- Orthogonality
	- Symmetric Matrices
Bullet Points:
	- MATH 1554 is a much more in-depth course that covers additional topics such as singular value decomposition (SVD).
	- MATH 1564 is the honors equivalent, which uses proofs and is more theoretical than MATH 1553.
Bullet Points:
	- The course page for MATH 1553 provides information about the course.
	- https://gatech.instructure.com/courses/114544 provides a set of videos and old exams for MATH 1554. Since MATH 1554 covers all the topics in MATH 1553, this resource can easily be used for MATH 1553 as well.
	- Interactive Linear Algebra is a free online, interactive textbook made by Georgia Tech professors for MATH 1553.
	- 3blue1brown Essence of Linear Algebra Video Series provides a nice conceptual overview of linear algebra. The video series uses visuals and animations extensively.
