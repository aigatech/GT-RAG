Title: iGniTe
Content:
	iGniTe is a first-year summer program at Georgia Tech that takes place during the late short summer session. Within the program, students take 6-7 credit hours of courses including a 1-credit GT 1000 course themed to one of the eight available tracks. During the program there are activities available to all iGniTe participants as well as co-curricular activities aimed towards particular tracks. Students can join iGniTe either by receiving summer acceptance or applying to iGniTe after gaining fall acceptance.
	Tracks impact the theme of the GT 1000 class that a student takes as well as the activities they participate in during iGniTe. After being accepted to iGniTe students apply to particular tracks and are accepted unless a track runs out of space. Tracks, other than the First Year Abroad track, have no impact on the courses a student is allowed to take.
	The Analyzing Atlanta track focuses on a study of the Atlanta area, including culture, history, and people. Co-curricular activities include touring around Atlanta.
	The Architecture & Design track focuses on architecture and the impact of design on experience. Co-curricular activities include tours of the Kendeda building and Ponce City Market as well as presentations from designers.
	The Innovation track focuses on entrepreneurship and creative problem solving. Co-curricular activities include visiting local startups and presentations from Georgia Tech alumni.
	The Leadership track focuses on learning the principles of leadership and cooperation. Co-curricular activities include the GT challenge course and visiting the center for civil and human rights.
	The Pre-Health track helps students explore opportunities for individuals interested in health and wellness-related careers (both medical practice and medical/health research). Co-curricular activities include information sessions by medical professionals and tours of labs.
	The Sustainable Communities track focuses on creating sustainable communities. Co-curricular activities include tours of the Kendeda building.
	The Undergraduate Research track focuses on research opportunities and expectations at Georgia Tech. Co-curricular activities include workshops and information sessions about undergraduate research including some led by graduate students and doctoral students as well as tours of labs and the invention studio.
	The First Year Fall Abroad track is significantly different and smaller than the other tracks. Around 50 students will be on the Atlanta campus for the late short summer session but will spend their fall semester at Georgia Tech Lorraine, the GT campus in Metz, France. There is a limited course selection for these individuals during the fall and the courses supplied during the summer are meant to support their academic pursuits in France.
