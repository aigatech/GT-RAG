Title: Thread (Computer Science)
Content:
	Like Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science offers eight distinct threads, which act as specializations. Majors must complete two threads + the core and major requirements to graduate. CS minors must select one thread and complete the minor core requirements (these do not include MATH requirements or some intro CS classes). Each thread combination also dictates the number of free electives a student must take in order to graduate.
	Take CS 2110:
	Take CS 2200:
	Unsure → take CS 3210:
	Take CS 2050/CS 2051/MATH 3012:
	Take CS 3510/CS 3511:
	Take CS 3600:
	Take CS 4510:[Note 4]
	Take MATH 3012:
	Stage 1 - Take CS3001 and PSYC1101
	LIKE BOTH → Consider people
	LIKE ONE → Consider people, but choose thread picks carefully
	HATE BOTH → Probably not, unless really enjoy CS 3750
	Stage 2 - Take CS 3750/CS3783.
	LIKE → Probably take People/Media.
	Stage 3 - Take MATH 3670 sooner rather than later allowing you to take PSYC 2015 sooner.
	LIKE 2015 → Definitely people.
	1. Take PSYC 2210/PSYC 2760/PSYC 3040 depending on what you liked in PSYC 1101 and PSYC 2015
	2. Choose thread picks based on preference between CS 3750 topics vs PSYC 1101/2015 vs CS 3001 topics.
	Liked PSYC 1101/2015 More - Consider CS 3790, CS 4472, CS 4460
	Liked CS 3750 More - Consider CS 4470, CS 4605
	CS 4660, CS 4745 are a bit of a wild card
	Take MATH 1554
	LIKE --> Media could be for you (esp if you liked Homogeneous Coordinates)
	HATE --> Definitely not Media
	Take CS 2261 or CS 2110
	LIKE 2261 --> Media is very probably for you
	HATE 2261 --> Likely not Media
	LIKE 2110 GBA Project --> Media may well be for you
	HATE 2110 GBA Project --> Unclear
	Take CS 3451 - choose thread picks on comparison of 3451 and 2261.
	Like 3451 more than 2261:
	Like 2261 more than 3451:
	Take CS 2051:
