Title: Information Internetworks
Content:
	The Information Internetworks thread, one of the eight threads available to undergraduate computer science majors and minors, focuses on representing, transforming, and transmitting data. Thread topics include computer networking, information security, and relational databases.
	For Computer Science majors, the following courses are required to complete the Information Internetworks thread:[1]
	Pick 2 from Introduction to Information Management
	Pick 1 from Advanced Information Management
	The Minor in Computing & Information Internetworks involves 17 credit hours and involves the following courses.[2] The thread pick requirements are the same as for Computer Science majors, but the non-thread requirements are reduced to CS 2110 and CS 2200.
	Pick 2 from Introduction to Information Management:
	Pick 1 from Advanced Information Management:
