Title: GT Student Wiki:Privacy policy
Content:
	I have no idea what I'm doing and will probably accidentally dump the database somewhere I shouldn't, which would leak email/password logins.
	But hey, I probably won't be the first website to do that! Check https://haveibeenpwned.com/ to see which other websites have already leaked your passwords.
	TLDR; pls don't re-use passwords; especially don't use important ones here
	If you aren't logged in, they will be displayed publicly. This is to prevent spamming.
	Like wikipedia. duh
