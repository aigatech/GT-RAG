Title: Electrical Engineering
Content:
	Electrical Engineering is a Bachelors of Science program at Georgia Tech, falling under the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering and within the College of Engineering.  It is a discipline of engineering dedicated to the study, design, and application of any device that uses electricity or electromagnetism.  Electrical engineering is a remarkably broad field.  Career paths exist in controls engineering, power engineering, microelectronics engineering, and signal processing.  Exposure to concepts in computer science can also prepare electrical engineers for work more loosely connected to the field.
Georgia Tech's School of Electrical and Computer Engineering boasts over 1,400 undergraduate students, over 1,100 graduate students, over 20,000 alumni, and is ranked 5th in electrical engineering.[1] [2]  Of 163 degrees awarded in the 2020-2021 academic year, 142 recipients were male with the remaining 21 being female.[3]
	Eta Kappa Nu (HKN), the national electrical engineering honors society, founded its Beta Mu chapter at Georgia Tech in 1904.[4]  Juniors with a GPA of 3.5 or higher, seniors with a GPA of 3.4 or higher, and graduate students in good standing are eligible to join HKN.[5]  The organization hosts numerous social, corporate, and service events throughout the school year.[6]  Two scholarships, each of $1,000, are available to one undergraduate and one junior in fall and spring, respectively.
	The Hive is a student-led organization within the Van Leer Interdisciplinary Design Commons.[7]  The Hive provides students with a number of tools, including 3D printers, PCB fab, wood shop, laser cutters, and electronics stations.[8]  In order to use these machines, students must register for the "shared user management system" (or "SUMS") and undergo machine specific training.[9]  As a student-led organization, The Hive offers volunteer positions for "Peer Instructors," who staff The Hive while general users work within the makerspace.[10]
	Georgia Tech IEEE, a chapter of IEEE, provides access to the largest professional society of electrical and computer engineers.[11]  Georgia Tech chapter of IEEE offers weekly tutoring sessions for 2000 and 3000-level electrical engineering courses, including ECE2026 and ECE 3040.[12]  Georgia Tech IEEE offers undergraduates experience and workshops in two teams, Innovation and Hardware.  The Innovation Team focuses on microcontroller programming, PCB design, and application development.  The Hardware Team focuses on design and fabrication of robots, including PCB design, microcontroller programming, CAD, and manufacturing.[13]  Georgia Tech IEEE is sponsored by relevant companies and organizations within the electrical engineering community, including Qualcomm, Texas Instruments, and Northrop Grumman.[14]
	Women in Electrical Engineering (or WECE) provides academic support, professional development, social events, and community outreach for female electrical engineers.[15]  The organization was founded in Fall 2004 and is sponsored by companies like Cisco, 3M, and Qualcomm.[16]
	Other relevant organizations include the Amateur Radio Club, the Black Graduate Student Organization, Engineers without Borders, the Invention Studio, HyTech Racing Team, RoboJackets, and Tau Beta Pi.
	The ubiquity of electronics and electricity in all fields creates a number of possible positions and fields for electrical engineers.  The following list is not exhaustive, further information can be found through C2D2.
	It should be noted, first off, that electrical engineers enjoy a great degree of financial security in the U.S.  The number of jobs available and the limited quantity of qualified engineers to fill them has driven the median annual salary of a Georgia Tech electrical engineer to $77,000.[17]
	Options outside of engineering are also available to electrical engineers.  For example, a bachelor's in EE is extremely attractive to law firms because of its application in patent law.
	That being said, the curriculum for Tech's electrical engineering major is notoriously strenuous.  Many classes (i.e. ECE 2031, ECE 3043) have a strong reputation of taking far more than their allotted weekly lab times.  If you find yourself struggling with math-heavy classes like ECE 2026 but enjoying programming-heavy classes like ECE 2036, consider changing your major to Computer Engineering or Computer Science.
	Electrical engineering offers threads, or specializations, in eight different areas. Each thread acts as a specialization and also dictates the number of hours of free electives each student gets.
	These include:
	Each thread offers further specializations.  For instance, the Robotics & Autonomous Systems thread offers specializations in Sensing & Exploration, Electrical Energy Systems, and Telecommunications (among many others).
