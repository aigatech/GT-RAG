Title: Thread
Content:
	A thread is a specialization within several majors or minors at Georgia Tech, such as Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and Computer Engineering.
	A Computer Science major must take two of the eight available threads to fulfill degree requirements.[1]
	The eight threads are:
	For Computer Science, Information Internetworks is the most popular thread, followed by Intelligence, as of 2017.[2]
	A Computational Media major must take one thread from the College of Computing, and one thread from either the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts or the College of Design.
	The three CS threads available are:
	The four threads offered jointly by the Ivan Allen College and the College of Design are:
