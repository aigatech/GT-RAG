Title: CS 3600 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
Content:
	
	CS 3600: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence is a 3-credit Computer Science course. It focuses on the theory and implementation of intelligent artificial agents. It is a required course in the Intelligence thread of the Computer Science major or minor.
	Coursework includes programming projects in Python and exams.
	Topics include:[1]
	The textbook used is Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig. The textbook is not required.
	CS 3600 is heavily based on UC Berkeley's open course CS 188: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence.
	The official prerequisite for the course is CS 1332. It is helpful to have prior experience in Python programming and basic probability, as well as perhaps linear algebra, calculus, and computational complexity.[1]
	Taking this course is helpful before taking CS 4641: Machine Learning or CS 3630: Robotics and Perception, which are comparatively harder courses, but it is not a prerequisite.
