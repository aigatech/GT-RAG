Title: Computer Engineering
Content:
	Computer Engineering (CompE) is a Bachelors of Science program at Georgia Tech, falling under the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering and within the College of Engineering. The field of computer engineering is centered in digital design, computer architecture, computer networks and internetworking, and computer applications.[1]
	Computer Engineering has the same General Core as Electrical Engineering, with the exception of the different multivariable calculus requirement.
	The Computer Engineering bachelor's degree has nine threads to specialize in.
	Students may select:
	These threads include:
Bullet Points:
	- Two CompE Threads
	- One CompE Thread & One CS Thread
	- One CompE Thread & One EE Thread
