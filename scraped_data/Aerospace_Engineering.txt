Title: Aerospace Engineering
Content:
	Aerospace Engineering is a Bachelor's of Science program offered by the Georgia Institute of Technology. Located within the College of Engineering, one of the six major colleges that make up Georgia Tech, it is one of the most reputable aerospace engineering programs nationally and worldwide for both the undergraduate and graduate levels. As of the 2022-2023 US News and World Report, Georgia Tech is tied with MIT for the #1 best undergraduate aerospace program in the country [1].
	The school of Aerospace Engineering offers an aerospace engineering minor for students that are not aerospace engineering majors.
