Title: MATH 2551 - Multivariable Calculus
Content:
	MATH 2551 covers limits, differentiation, and integration of functions with more than one input and/or output.  It is a requirement for engineering majors.
	* Topic not covered in MATH 2550
	MATH 2551 is a core math class focused more on computation than pure theory. Typical problems can be quite lengthy, especially towards the end of the course.
	Single variable calculus is an important prerequisite for MATH 2551. Multivariable calculus applies single variable calculus concepts such as limits, derivatives, and integrals to functions with more than one input and/or output. Multivariable calculus should not be seen as the next course in a linear sequence of calculus courses; rather, it should be seen as an outward expansion of all single variable calculus topics. For example, while no new integration techniques are introduced in multivariable calculus, with the exception of the Jacobian, the concept of integration is extended in multivariable calculus by applying it to 2D and 3D regions in new coordinate systems.
	Although linear algebra is listed as a prerequisite for MATH 2551, topics that require prior knowledge of linear algebra are rarely seen in MATH 2551. For example, while multiple topics in MATH 2551 use vectors extensively, vectors are reviewed at the beginning of the course, making prior knowledge of vectors unrequired. However, linear algebra does provide a more theoretical background for concepts such as the dot product and matrix determinant, which may be helpful for MATH 2551.
	MATH 2551 is required by most engineering and science majors. It is also a prerequisite itself for many classes required by engineering and science majors. Due to its prerequisites, MATH 2551 is generally taken sometime between late freshmen year and early sophomore year.
