Title: ECE 2020 - Fundamentals of Digital Design
Content:
	ECE 2020 is a 3 credit hour class with no lab requirement. It is a requirement for both electrical engineering and computer engineering majors.[1] ECE 2020 places emphasis on understanding Boolean algebra and gate design.[2] Several lab projects utilizing the myDAQ, a data acquisition device also used in ECE 2040 and ECE 3084, are featured in the course. Students are required to purchase a myDAQ for ECE 2020.
	This topic list is from spring 2021.[1]
	ECE 2031 is taken after ECE 2020, and both courses cover similar topics.
