Title: MATH 2552 - Differential Equations
Content:
	MATH 2552 covers ordinary differential equations and Laplace transforms.
	MATH 2552 is a core math class focused more on computation than pure theory.
	At the beginning of the course, Chen posts a comprehensive course schedule that contains all topics, lecture notes, and textbook exercises. In addition, Chen makes lectures and studios optional, allowing the course to be easily self-studied. Chen's quizzes and exams tend to be straightforward, containing problems very similar to the textbook examples, if not easier.
	Single variable calculus is used extensively throughout MATH 2552. Differential equations is often considered to be another calculus course, and uses differentiation and/or integration in almost every topic. Partial fraction decomposition is used frequently when working with Laplace transforms.
	Linear algebra is also used extensively throughout MATH 2552. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are used to analyze systems of differential equations and second order linear differential equations. Other linear algebra topics, such as row reduction, linear combinations, and linear independence are also used in the analysis of these types of differential equations.
	MATH 2552 is required by most engineering and science majors, and it is also required for the modsim thread in cs. It is a prerequisite itself for many classes required by engineering and science majors. Due to its prerequisites, MATH 2552 is generally taken sometime between late freshmen year and early sophomore year.
