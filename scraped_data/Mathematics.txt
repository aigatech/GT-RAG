Title: Mathematics
Content:
	Mathematics is a Bachelors of Science program at Georgia Tech, falling under the School of Mathematics and within the College of Sciences. Mathematics is independent of other sciences and engineering fields, generally concerned with the study of topics like quantities and space. Mathematicians can go on to become actuaries, cryptographers, statisticians, economists, and other fields involving numbers. Mathematics is generally seen as a good foundation of computer science given how much computer science relies on concepts such as logic and discrete mathematics for algorithms, computer infrastructure, and programming.
	Georgia Tech's School of Mathematics is ranked 26th in mathematics,[1] having over 600 undergraduates and 800 graduate students.
	Pi Mu Epsilon is a National Mathematics Honor Society whose purpose is to promote scholarly activities in mathematics among students, staff, faculty, and graduates. The Georgia Beta Chapter at Georgia Tech was established in 1958 and organizes the annual Georgia Tech High School Mathematics Competition. Undergraduates must have completed at least 2 semesters of calculus and 2 upper mathematical classes before being eligible to join. [2] The organization hosts the annual Georgia Tech High School Mathematics Competition (HSMC).
	Club Math is a social organization for students at Georgia Tech with an interest in mathematics. They meet weekly to discuss problems and puzzles, play games, and learn about interesting topics beyond the scope of what is taught in the classroom. In addition, Club Math also engages in mathematical crafting such as origami and mathematical knitting as well as movie nights. For the Fall 2021 semester, they meet in Skiles 006 on Tuesday from 5-6 pm.
	Actuary Club assists prospective and practicing actuaries from the Georgia Tech community enabling them to come together to help one another find resources, give guidance, and make new contacts.
