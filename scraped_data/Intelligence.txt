Title: Intelligence
Content:
	The Intelligence thread is one of the eight threads available to undergraduate Computer Science majors and minors.
	The intelligence thread focuses on top-to-bottom computational models of intelligence. It emphasizes varying levels of intelligence and natural cognitive agents such as humans, ants, or bees. Students learn skills and knowledge for expressing, specifying, understanding, creating, and explaining computational models that represent cognitive models. The intelligence thread includes fields ranging from artificial intelligence, machine learning, perception, cognitive science and more.
	For majors who decide to do intelligence as one of their two threads, the requirements are below:
	For non-majors who elect to do the Computing and Intelligence minor, the requirements are below:
	Before announcing your intention to declare the minor, you must take and pass CS 1301, CS 1315, or CS 1371 with a B or higher and CS 1331 with a B or higher. Else, you will not be allowed to continue in, or declare, the minor.
