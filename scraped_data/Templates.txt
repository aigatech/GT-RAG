Title: Templates
Content:
	Templates are a powerful tool to add information to new course, major, or other pages.  This should simplify and standardize the ability for editors to compile information on any topic.
	To create a template, make a new page with the following syntax:
	Template:foo
	This template can then be used using the following syntax.  Note: if this format is used, any updates to the template will be shown on pages it is used within.
	\{\{foo\}\}
	This could be useful for adding major requirements to pages.
	To use that template and edit boilerplate text, use the following syntax:
	{{subst:foo}}
	This could be useful for creating new major or course pages.
