	ECE2031 has been the most impactful, practical class in my time at Tech; it truly establishes useful skills of the trade that any electrical or computer engineer needs from using scopes to blinking LEDs. If I could, I would retake this class as an elective to gain more understanding of the plethora of features the DE2 offers as a state of the art FPGA. I currently make SRAM on the side as a personal hobby. ECE2031 taught me if I don't have enough storage for all the important things in life, I can just make more.
