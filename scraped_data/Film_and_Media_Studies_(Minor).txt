Title: Film and Media Studies
Content:
	Film and Media Studies is a program offered under the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Art's School of Literature, Media, and Communication. It can be taken either as a thread in the Computational Media major or a minor for non-majors. The Literature, Media, and Communication major offers the thread under the name Media.
	The Film and Media Studies program aims to instill a nuanced perspective of film and other forms of media within its students.
