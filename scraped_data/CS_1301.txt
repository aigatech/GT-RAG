Title: CS 1301 - Introduction to Computing
Content:
	CS 1301, formally known as Introduction to Computing, is an introductory 3 credit hour CS class aimed at people with zero or near-zero programming experience, and provides a gentle introduction to Python programming, with the context of using Python in non-computing contexts.  CS 1301 is taken by nearly all majors.
	As of Spring 2021, the topics covered in the class were:
	Since this class is built for beginners, no prerequisite knowledge, other than basic algebra, is required!
	For CS, CompE, EE, and Math majors with the Discrete Math concentration, CS 1301 is probably the most important class to complete, as it essentially unlocks the rest of the degree. Therefore, it is extremely critical that this class is completed as early as possible. Classes that directly require CS 1301 are: CS 1331 (Introduction to OOP), CS 4400 (Introduction to Databases), and ECE 2020 (Digital System Design).
	CS 1301 is not a linked course, but does have an optional recitation section (under the label CS 1301R).
	When registering for this course, you must register for a lecture section (the ones marked by a single letter: A, B, C) under CS 1301. If you decide to take a recitation section as well, you must register for a section under CS 1301R that corresponds to the same lecture section letter that you picked. For example, if you registered for Section B lecture, you must register for a recitation section that starts with B (e.g. B01, B04, etc.).
