	Hm, I wouldn't say that dual booting is slower, because it isn't. It just takes up more disk space, and of course you have to reboot to switch between operating systems. --Alexp (talk) 21:35, 23 May 2021 (EDT)
	Ya oops I'm a windows guy - I meant the GT VMs, not Mac dual boot - Jonathan Stewart
	Don't buy a computer based on the software, software can be changed. You can install any operating system in an VM or to dual boot. Even a chromebook can run linux. - MattPerry
