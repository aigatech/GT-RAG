Title: Mechanical Engineering
Content:
	Mechanical Engineering is a Bachelors of Science program at Georgia Tech within the College of Engineering.
	Mechanical Engineering is notorious for having lengthy prerequisite chains, so mechanical engineering students should plan their schedules carefully. The most important prerequisite chain is MATH 1551 to MATH 1552 and PHYS 2211 to COE 2001. All classes in this prerequisite chain should be taken as early as possible, since almost all mechanical engineering courses require COE 2001 or its postrequisites.
